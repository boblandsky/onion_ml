# Machine learning with Onion headlines

## Goal:
Determining whether a headline is from the Onion or not

---
The best place to get absurd headlines is the Onion. Sometimes real life beats out the Onion in absurdity. 
Here, I use two different estimators from Python's scikit-learn (logistic regression and naive Bayes) as well as the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) to process the headlines. The app uses these estimators to determine whether or not a given headline is from the Onion or r/NotTheOnion.
